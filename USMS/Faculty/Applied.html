                <h2>HISTORY OF THE FACULTY</h2>
                The FAS consists of five Departments viz: Biological Sciences, Chemical Sciences, 
                Computing, Health Promotion and Physical Sciences. The Department of Biological Sciences offers
                ourses in the fields of Botany, Zoology and Biology while the Department of Physical Sciences
                offers courses in the fields of Chemistry, Physics, Pure Mathematics, Applied Mathematics and
                Statistics. The Department of Health Promotion offers courses in Health Promotion and the
                Department of Computing offers courses in Computer Science and Information Technology. 
                The Department of Chemical Sciences offers courses in the field of Chemistry. Currently 
                the Faculty has over 100 employees which includes Professors, Senior Lecturers, Lecturers,
                Technicians and Administrative Officers, and 833 students. <br><br>
            
                From its inception, the Faculty follows the course unit system. The programs are completed 
                within 6 semesters in the case of 3-year degree programs and 8 semesters in the case of 
                4-year degree programs. Almost all courses are designed, taught and overseen by the Faculty
                of Applied Sciences and all Faculty are required to teach as part of their duties. Since the
                class sizes are small it allows a closer student-teacher relationship at the Faculty.
                The Faculty conducts research of high quality and practical value in the fields of Biology,
                Chemistry, Physics, Information Technology, Health Promotion, Mathematics and Statistics.
