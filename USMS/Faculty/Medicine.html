            <p><h2>ABOUT THE FACULTY</h2>
                FMAS provides hostel accommodation facilities for the undergraduate medical students from first 
                to final year which in total is about seven hundred male and female students. All the students
                who are eligible, in terms of distance to the faculty premises, are given hostel facilities. 
                Currently there are two university owned internal hostel complexes; located in Saliyapura FMAS 
                premises (Vijayabahu hostel), and in Anuradhapura town area (Pandukabhaya Hostel) close to
                Professorial Unit, Teaching Hospital, Anuradhapura. <br> <br>

                In addition there are ten external hostels rented by RUSL, to cater  the needs of current 
                student community . Residential students are provided with transport facilities to and from 
                Saliyapura FMAS premises and Teaching Hospital, Anuradhapura.  Student needs are well looked
                after by a readily contactable efficient staff team including sub wardens and wardens. Besides,
                the support and care for students are further heightened through a hostel committee headed by
                the Dean, FMAS.

                <h2>HISTORY OF THE FACULTY</h2>
                Faculty maximally utilizes its available infrastructure facilities for teaching and learning,
                while on course for further expansion of infrastructure. Lecture halls are equipped with 
                multimedia projectors, sound systems, computers, overhead projectors, and whiteboards to 
                facilitate achieving faculty ILOs. <br><br>

                Our student counsellors offer, confidential and non-judgmental support to students who are
                experiencing personal and/or academic concerns. Most of the medical undergraduates are going
                through different pressures and difficulties associated with academic work as well as due
                to peer pressure, isolation and separation from home etc. Students use counselling for all 
                kinds of different reasons and you donâ€™t need to be in a crisis to meet our counsellors. 
                Student counsellors in FMAS are not providing professional counselling services as registered
                counsellors, but we are here to help and refer you to appropriate services based on your 
                needs. Our services can help you to find ways forward, make decisions, gain new perspectives,
                discover solutions and come to terms with and manage challenging life events. We have a
                young team of student counsellors and you can talk to us about any personal, social or 
                emotional concern, whether or not it is affecting your work or studies. At present the
                ounselling services have a close collaboration with external resources for those who need 
                professional or clinical interventions.
